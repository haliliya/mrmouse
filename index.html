<h1>Ans</h1>
<p><b>Q1</b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <u>Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0 differ in their characteristics as described below:</u>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <u>Web access:</u> As the versions progress, Web access is wider.
  <br/>
  <b>Web 1.0 </b>- considered as a Read only web, enabling searching and reading of information. 
  <br/>
   <b>Web 2.0</b> - also allows editing of content, as it is a Read and Write web. 
   <br/>
  <b>Web 3.0</b>  - additionally supports data which can be processed by machines, which makes it a Read, Write and execute web.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <u>Web targets:</u> Web goals alter between versions.
  <br/>
  <b>Web 1.0 </b> - a platform making information accessible to it's target audience.
  <br/>
  <b>Web 2.0</b> - serves as an interface for interpersonal interactions including "relationship" technologies , participatory media and a social digital technology.
  <br/>
  <b>Web 3.0</b> - intends to perform learning of knowledge.   
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <u>Web popularity:</u> number of users grows as the versions are more advanced.
  <br/>
  <b>Web 1.0 </b> - millions of users.
  <br/>
  <b>Web 2.0</b> - billions of users.
  <br/>
  <b>Web 3.0</b> - Trillions of users.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <u>Web content creators and content consumers:</u>
  <br/>
  <b>Web 1.0 </b> - Companies create content which people consume passively.
  <br/>
  <b>Web 2.0</b> - People are both content creators and consumers. 
  <br/>
  <b>Web 3.0</b> - People generate high level content which other people can interact with.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <u>search engines:</u>  
  <br/>
  <b>Web 1.0 </b> - search engines retrieve macro content. Although searching is performed rapidly, the search results are mostly inaccurate or irrelevant, as the results are often too general.
   <br/>
   <b>Web 2.0</b> - search engines retrieve tags with micro contents (pictures, links, events, news, blogs, audio, video, etc.). The process of tagging is manual, tedious and covers negligible percentages of the web. 
   <br/>
   <b>Web 3.0</b>- search engines will retrieve micro content automatically tagged texts, which would most likely result in more precise search.
   <br/>
   <br/>
  <b>Q2</b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <u>Suppose you want to watch a comedy movie and eat dinner at an Asian restaurant:</u>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>Web 1.0 </b> - You would probably visit different static websites with movies and restaurant related content. You will perform integration of the data independently, and make your decision based solely on factual details such as: a list of movies which are currently playing at the movie theaters, a list of restaurants and a list of movie theaters. The process may be very tedious, as the results are not necessarily specific or concise. 
  <br/>
  <b>Web 2.0</b> - You turn on your laptop and open a web browser. Then, you go to the google page and perform a search for movie theatres, movies and restaurants. You find out which are good comedy movies to watch and which movie theatres are playing those movies. You spend time reviewing descriptions of the films in order to decide. You search for Asian restaurants near by. You also check the reviews of the places described above. You may have spent a meaningful amount of time to complete the planning. Also, you have most likely visited a lot of websites. 
  <br/>
  <b>Web 3.0</b> - will make search tasks faster, easier and more personalized. You would simply type a complex sentence or two ("I want to watch a comedy movie and then I would like to have dinner at an Asian restaurant") and the web 3.0 browser will display relevant results. The browser learns about your interests based on your usage. The browser would analyze the database, consider your current location and provide its suggestions.
